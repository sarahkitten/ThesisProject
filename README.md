Top-down Unity Game Prototype

For my 407 project, I plan to make a basic working prototype of the game I’ll be working on for my honors college thesis.  The player will fight against waves of enemies using a “grappling hook” which, when aimed and shot at an enemy, pulls the player quickly toward the enemy, then allows the player to rotate the enemy around them as a shield.  From this state, the player can shoot the enemy out as a projectile, propelling the player in the opposite direction.  The player’s regular movement will be slow, so it is necessary to use enemy grappling and the propulsion of the projectile to move around quickly.

By the end of the term, I would like to have a prototype of the above mechanics, with variables that I can tinker with in playtesting.  Then, I’ll be able to test and fine-tune the core gameplay experience before I start working on any other aspects of the game.

By the mid-term milestone, I’d like to have programmed the basic directional character movement, stationary enemies, and at least one of the two: grappling mechanic or projectile mechanic.  If all goes well before the end of the term and I can implement all these mechanics quickly, I can move on to programming waves of moving enemies for playtesting.

With this project, I want to create a solid foundation for my thesis project, and apply my knowledge from unity tutorials to a game I make from scratch.
